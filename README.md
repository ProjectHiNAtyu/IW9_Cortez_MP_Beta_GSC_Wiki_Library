# IW9_Cortez_MP_Beta_GSC_Wiki_Library

[ About ]


These functions and implementations have been reconstructed and utilized based on the code by Mr. Sku, who conceived, developed, and released the GSC Injection process in Project Donetsk.

I express my heartfelt respect and gratitude to Mr. Sku-111, who devised and implemented this injection process.
- Official GSCBIN Dumper
- Custom GSC Injector


I also used Mr. xensik's gsc-tool to decompile GSCBIN, extract source code, and create custom GSC.

Thank you Mr. Xensik for always providing cutting edge CoD GSC analysis.
- GSC Compiler
- GSC Decompiler


I would also like to express my sincere gratitude to Mr. ATE47, who has released features such as the asset pool and has diligently researched and disclosed information about new CoD GSC titles such as MWIII and BO6.


Thank you as always, I support you all.
